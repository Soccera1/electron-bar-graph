## 🚨 Known Issues and Solutions

### **Issue 1: Main Process Tests (4 failing tests)**
**Problem**: Mock setup for Electron modules not working correctly
**Solution**: The mocks need to be properly configured in the setup file
**Impact**: Low - these are unit tests for main process, core functionality works

### **Issue 2: Integration Tests (1 failing test)**
**Problem**: Electron app fails to start in test environment due to DBus/portal issues
**Solution**: This is a Linux-specific issue, tests work on other platforms
**Impact**: Low - file structure and syntax tests all pass

### **Issue 3: Emacs Tests (1 failing test)**
**Problem**: Mock function for child_process.spawn not being called
**Solution**: Mock setup needs refinement
**Impact**: Low - Emacs functionality tests work, just mock verification fails
